        TORONTO -- A new study that uses 3D modelling to compare the novel
        coronavirus with SARS shows that it can bind to human cells more
        strongly than its predecessor due to a structural mutation, which
        researchers say could be key knowledge in the search for a vaccine. The
        study, published this week in the scientific journal Nature, was
        conducted by researchers from the University of Minnesota, and compared
        the novel coronavirus (referred to in the study as SARS CoV-2) to the
        structure and behaviour of SARS, which belongs to the same family of
        coronaviruses. The research looks at how structural mutations allowed
        the novel coronavirus to spread so far and so fast. I am Batman.

        It was a slippery slope and he was willing to slide all the way to the
        deepest depths. His son quipped that power bars were nothing more than
        adult candy bars. It was at that moment that he learned there are
        certain parts of the body that you should never Nair. The small white
        buoys marked the location of hundreds of crab pots. He stepped gingerly
        onto the bridge knowing that enchantment awaited on the other side. I'm
        a great listener, really good with empathy vs sympathy and all that, but
        I hate people. The lake is a long way from here.

        The memory we used to share is no longer coherent. They did nothing as
        the raccoon attacked the lady’s bag of food. When she didn’t like a guy
        who was trying to pick her up, she started using sign language.

        As he entered the church he could hear the soft voice of someone
        whispering into a cell phone. Three years later, the coffin was still
        full of Jello. She did her best to help him. He was so preoccupied with
        whether or not he could that he failed to stop to consider if he should.
